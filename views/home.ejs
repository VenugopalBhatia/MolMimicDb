                    Pathogen proteins mimic those of the host and derail their action. A
                    linear pair has a host protein, its interactor and the pathogen protein
                    that mimics it. This kind of mimicry can be overall sequence similarity
                    e.g. similarity of protein structural domains or <b>Domain Linear Pair (DLP)</b>
                    as shown in Figure 1a. Alternatively, local similarity can be present in the
                    form of linear sequence <b>Motif Linear Pair(MLP)</b> as shown in Figure 1b.
                    As experimentally interacting proteins are likely to be co-expressed and
                    co-localized, interaction data adds confidence to prediction of host
                    pathogen mimicry candidates.

                            <b>ImitateDB</b> is a comprehensive database for information about molecular
                            mimicry candidates represented as DLPs and MLPs for each
                            experimentally validated unique host pathogen protein-protein
                            interaction. The database contains a total of unique 2,06,449 DLPs and
                            38,45,643 MLPs searchable by various options. Specific domains or
                            motifs mimicked commonly by a large number of pathogens are likely to
                            be responsible for microbial virulence suitable for drug/vaccine targeting.
