                    Pathogen proteins mimic those of the host and derail their action. A linear pair has a
                    host protein, its interactor and the pathogen protein that mimics it. This kind of mimicry
                    can be overall sequence similarity e.g. similarity of protein structural domains or Domain
                    Mimicry Pair (DMP) as shown in Figure 1a. Alternatively, local similarity can be present
                    in the form of linear sequence Motif Mimicry Pair (MMP) as shown in Figure 1b. Figure
                    1a and 1b shows a scenario encompassing a competitive mode of binding of both
                    interaction partners to the same protein. However, allosteric modes of binding are
                    also possible as shown in Figure 2a for DMP and 2b for MMP. As experimentally
                    interacting proteins are likely to be co-expressed and co-localized, interaction data adds
                    confidence to prediction of host pathogen mimicry candidates.

                            <b>ImitateDB</b> is a comprehensive database for information about molecular mimicry
                            candidates represented as DMPs and MMPs for each experimentally validated unique
                            host pathogen protein-protein interaction. The database contains a total of unique
                            2,06,449 DMPs and 38,45,643 MMPs searchable by various options. Specific domains
                            or motifs mimicked commonly by a large number of pathogens are likely to be
                            responsible for microbial virulence suitable for drug/vaccine targeting.
